					<h2>Introduction to UX</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>The Basics</h3>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>What is User Experience?</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							User experience (UX) focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and their limitations. It also takes into account the business goals and objectives of the group managing the project.<br><br>UX best practices promote improving the quality of the user’s interaction with and perceptions of your product and any related services.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Factors that influence UX</h2>
					<img src="https://eu.landisgyr.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Finland_blog/Better_Tech_Blog/figure1.png?t=1521191709612&width=311&name=figure1.png" class="noborder"/>
				</section>
				
				<section>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Useful:</b> Your content should be original and fulfill a need</li>
							<li><b>Usable:</b> Site must be easy to use</li>
							<li><b>Desirable:</b> Image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation</li>
							<li><b>Findable:</b> Content needs to be navigable and locatable onsite and offsite</li>
							<li><b>Accessible:</b> Content needs to be accessible to people with disabilities</li>
							<li><b>Credible:</b> Users must trust and believe what you tell them</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Usability and UX are not the same thing</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							The usability of a website is a crucial part that shapes its UX – so it falls under the umbrella of UX. Some may think that the usability is solely about the “ease of use” of a site, but it involves much more than that.<br><br>Usability is more than just about if users can perform tasks easily (ease-of-use). It also deals with the user’s satisfaction – for a website to be useable, it must be engaging and aesthetically pleasing, too. 
						</p>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>Why does Usability matter?</h2>
						<p>
							If users cannot achieve their goals efficiently and effectively, they are likely to seek an alternative solution to reach their goals.<br><br>
						<p>	
							<b>If your product is not usable, its UX will be bad, and users will leave your site for a competitor – plain and simple.</b>
						</p>
				</section>	
			
				<section>
					<h2>What is Web Accessibility?</h2>
						<div align="left">
							Accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web</li>
							<li>Contribute to the web</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</section>	
					
				<section>
						<p>Accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the web, including:
						<ul>
							<li>Auditory</li>
							<li>Cognitive</li>
							<li>Neurological </li>
							<li>Psychical </li>
							<li>Speech</li>
							<li>Visual</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
				</section>					
					
				<section>
						<p>Accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, including:
						<ul>
							<li>People using mobile devices, smart watches, smart TVs, and other small screen devices, different inputs, etc.</li>
							<li>Elderly people with changing abilities due to ageing.</li>
							<li>People with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses.</li>
							<li>People with “situational limitations” such as bright sunlight or an environment where they cannot access audio.</li>
							<li>People using a slow internet connection or have limited bandwidth.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
				</section>					
					
				<section>
					<h2>Why is Accessibility important?</h2>
						<div align="left">
							The web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of abilities.<br><Br><b>Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and tools, and not exclude people from using their products or services.</b>
					</div>
				</section>					
					
				<section>
					<p>The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops technical specifications, guidelines, techniques, and supporting resources that describe accessibility solutions. These are considered international standards for web accessibility. <br>

					<h2>UX Design Process</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>The in's and out's</h3>
						<p>
					
						</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>What does a UX process look like?</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>A UX design process is something that everyone does differently because the process depends heavily on the project.<br><br>Different projects require different approaches: the approach to a corporate website differs from the way you might design a social media app. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/78/fb/44/78fb444ea2f36972782e927e4cfb94af.png" class="noborder"/>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>Strategy</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Stakeholder Discussions:</b> Interviewing key stakeholders for a project allows you to gather insights about their goals and values. </li>
							<li><b>Project Vision/Goals:</b> Map out the key aspects of the product – what is it, who it’s for and when/where it will be used.</li>
							<li><b>Brand Strategy:</b> Creating an early mockup/idea of what is going to be built. </li>
							<li><b>Project Kick-off Meeting:</b> Sets the proper expectations for both the team and stakeholders – outlines the products purpose, includes who is involved in the project, sets expectations for measuring product success (such as KPI’s) and the overall project priority. </li>
						</ul> 
					<p>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>Discovery</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Competitive Research:</b> Research and analysis of competitor products helps the UX designer understand industry standards and identifies opportunity to improve the product.</li>
							<li><b>Surveys/Interviews:</b> Having a good understanding of your users is essential – who are they, what do they need, what motivates them?</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
		
				<section>
					<h2>Analysis</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Personas:</b> Fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might use your product. The purpose of personas is to create reliable and realistic representations of the audience for reference. </li>
							<li><b>Experience Maps:</b> Design tool used to understand the product interactions from the user’s point of view. It’s a visual representation that illustrates the users experience within a product.</li>
							<li><b>Storyboarding:</b> An effective and inexpensive way to capture, relate, and explore experiences in the design process. It’s a visual representation of stories to communicate user issues to stakeholders.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>	
	
				<section>
					<h2>Design</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Site Mapping:</b> Site maps give you a visual representation of the sites organization and how different sections are linked together.</li>
							<li><b>Sketching:</b> Drawing by hand is the fastest way to visualize a concept and allows the designer to explore options.</li>
							<li><b>Wireframes:</b> A visual guide that represents page structure (hierarchy and key elements) – think of this as the skeleton of the sites design.</li>
							<li><b>Prototypes:</b> Builds off the wireframe and incorporates the look and feel. A prototype is a simulation of the product, commonly using clickable functionality.</li>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
	
				<section>
					<h2>Production</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>User Testing:</b> User testing sessions serve as validation of design, based on tests with real users. These sessions differ in form, such as usability testing, focus groups, beta testing, A/B testing, and surveys. </li>
							<li><b>Record Findings:</b> Gather quantitative data from testing feedback and research being conducted to improve or iterate the design. </li>
							<li><b>Metrics Analysis:</b> Use an analytics tool to gather qualitative data about how users interact with your product: clicks, navigation time, search queries etc.</li>
						</ul>

	<!-- Research and Understanding - Who, what, where? -->
				<section>
					<img src="https://edsurge.imgix.net/uploads/post/image/9525/shutterstock_287254541-1489449787.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=2000&h=810&fit=crop" class="noborder"/>
					<h2>Research &amp; Understanding</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>Who, What, Where?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is UX Research?</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							The research part of UX is defined as an action where you investigate something systematically.<br><Br>In UX Research, you apply various techniques to add context and insight into the design process. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>			

				<section>
					<h2>UX Research Techniques</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							UX research methods are great at producing data and insights. User research can be done at any point in the design process.<br><br>UX methods can keep product-development efforts on track while aligning with the user’s needs. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Competitive Research</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							Conducting a competitive assessment needs to be part of the ongoing research process to deepen your understandings of the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors.<br><br>You will be able to track trends and scenarios then organize it in a way that can be utilized.  
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>Interviews</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							A common user research technique used typically to get qualitative information from either existing or potential users. Typically performed by two user experience professionals (one to interview and one to take notes) and can cover any range of topics (persons background, occupation, use of technology, their goals, motivations, and pain points).
<br><br>This will add vital information to any personas you design and help you understand your users.
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>Personas</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							Creating personas can provide a shared understanding of users in terms of goals and capabilities.<br><br>They can drive design decisions by discussing the users’ needs during the planning process. In most cases, personas are created from data collected from interviews. 
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<p> Persona Example:<br>

				<section>
					<h2>Card Sorting</h2>
					<img src="https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/5661bbe0d95b1.jpg" class="noborder"/>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							A method used to help design and evaluate the information architecture of a website. Subject experts or users will organize topics into categories that make sense to create a category tree. This is useful to map workflows, menu structure, or web site navigation paths. 
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>Experience Maps</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							A visual representation that illustrates the users flow (within a product or service), their needs, wants, expectations and overall experience for a goal.<br><br>A simple experience map only reflects one possible path during one scenario, while a complex map could encompass cross platform experiences or experiences occurring at different time sessions/scenarios.  
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<p>
						Simple Experience Map Example:

					<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
					<img src="http://www.mediabarnresearch.com/storage/slide1.jpg" class="noborder"/>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							During a usability test, you evaluate a product or service by testing it with real users. Participants will complete tasks while you observe their actions and takes notes.
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>Why is UX Research important?</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							UX research removes assumptions from the design process and you will have real data to back up your design decisions.<br><br>If research is done correctly it will save your organization valuable time and money.
						</p>	
					</div>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits of Mockups</h2> 
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Intuitive to stakeholders</b> – they can more easily see the final product.</li>
							<li><b>Realistic perspective</b> – they can reveal problems that aren’t so apparent on paper (color clashes, issues with typography, distribution of content, etc.) </li>
							<li><b>Early revisions</b> – easier to make revisions at this stage than in the later coding (prototype) stage.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is a Prototype?</h2>
					<img src="https://www.freetemplatesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image9.jpg" class="noborder"/>
						<p>
							A simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch.
						</p>

						<p>
							Works best in the initial stages of design, mainly for testing product ideas. They are fast, inexpensive and can be a great team-building exercise. They can also be kept as reference for future iterations. 
						</p>	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Digital Prototyping</h2>
						<img src="https://getflywheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/style-tile-example.jpg" class="noborder"/>
						<p>
							Most usual form of prototyping that is realistic enough to accurately test most UI elements and easier to produce than HTML prototypes. Can be built using apps and software made for prototyping.

				<section>
					<h2>Define Goals for the Study:</h2>
					<div align="left">	
						<p>
							Identify questions, concerns, areas of interest, and purpose of the research. <br><br>The goals will determine which UX research methodology to choose (interviews, moderated user testing, card sorting, A/B testing, etc.).
						</p>
					</div>	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Determine the Format and Setting of the Study:</h2>
					<div align="left">	
						<p>
						<u>Lab or in field:</u> Should you conduct the study at your facility or go to the participant?
						<bR><br>
						<u>Moderated or unmoderated:</u> Moderated studies tend to provide you with richer design input and gives you the opportunity to probe, get clarification, and are a better source of open-ended comments.
						<br><br>
						<u>In-person or remote:</u> When you are in the same room with the participant you are able to detect subtle cues such as body language and the overall experience is more personable.
						</p>
					</div>	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Determine number of Users:</h2>
					<div align="left">	
						<p>
							For traditional qualitative studies, a total of <b>5</b> participants is recommended. If your research involves more than one target user groups you may need to adjust the number of participants per group.

						<u>Exploratory tasks:</u> Open-ended tasks that answer broad, research-oriented goals and may or may not have the right answer. These tasks allow you to observe how people discover or explore information and are not appropriate for quantitative testing.<br><br>
						<u>Specific tasks:</u> Focused and have a correct answer or end point. They are used for both qualitative and quantities testing.

					<h2>Metrics Analysis</h2>
					<h3>Validate all the things</h3>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Metrics allow you to:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Track progress between releases</li>
							<li>Assess your competitive position</li>
							<li>Makes decisions before launch</li>
						</ul>		
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>How to Measure</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							It may be easy to specify usability metrics, but hard to collect them. Usability is typically measured relative to user’s performance on a given set of tasks.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Usability Metrics should include:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Effectiveness / success rate</li>
							<li>Efficiency</li>
							<li>Satisfaction</li>
						</ul>
					<br><br>
					<p>However, the actual ways of how these should be measured is left up to the evaluator.</p>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>Completion Rate</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							Effectiveness can be calculated by measuring completion rate – the fundamental usability metric. The completion rate is calculated by assigning a binary value of ‘1’ if the test participant manages to complete a task and ‘0’ if they do not. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>		
				
				<section>
				<img src="img/comprate.png" class="noborder"/>
					<br><br>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							You should always aim for a completion rate of 100% if possible, however, the completion rate is highly dependent on the context of the task being evaluated. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>					
				
				<section>
					<p>Example:</p><br>
					<img src="img/compexample.PNG" class="noborder"/>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<img src="http://usabilitygeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/usability-metrics-successful-completion-bar-chart.jpg" class="noborder"/>
					<p>It is very easy to graphically represent completion rate. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Measure Task Time</h2>
					<img src="img/tasktime.PNG" class="noborder"/>
					<div align ="left">
					<p>Efficiency is measured in terms of task time – seconds or minutes the participant takes to successfully complete a task. </p>
						</div>
				</section>				
				
				<section>
					<h2>Example:</h2>
					<table>
					  <tr>
					    <th></th>
					    <th><b>Original Design</b></th>
					    <th><b>Redesign</b></th>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td>Task 1</td>
					    <td>130 sec</td>
					    <td>89 sec</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td>Task 2</td>
					    <td>240 sec</td>
					    <td>121 sec</td>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td>Task 3</td>
					    <td>80 sec</td>
					    <td>30 sec</td>
					</table>
					<br><br>
					<p>You can then compare times during iterative rounds to testing to determine improvement. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Measuring Satisfaction</h2>
					<div align ="left">
					<p>User satisfaction is measured through standardized satisfaction questions which can be implemented after each task and/or after the usability test is completed.</p>
						</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Task Level Satisfaction</h2>
					<div align ="left">
					<p>After a user attempts a task they should immediately be given a questionnaire to measure how difficult the task was. </p>
						</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="http://www.measuringu.com/images/seq-image.jpg" class="noborder"/>
					<p>One of the most popular post-task questionnaires is Single Ease Question (SEQ). They are short and easy to respond to, administer and score.</p>
					
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Test Level Satisfaction</h2>
					<div align ="left">
					<p>Measured by giving a formalized questionnaire to each test participant at the end of the test session.<br><br>One of the most popular post-test questionnaires is the System Usability Scale (SUS). Mostly used to measure the user satisfaction with software, hardware and mobile devices.</p>
						</div>
				</section>
					
				<section>
					<p>SUS Example:</p>
					<img src="http://www.humanfactors.com/images/newsletters/2010/jan/SUS1.jpg" class="noborder"/>

					<h2>New Relic Insights</h2>
					<div align ="left">
					<p>Provides deep performance analytics for every part of the software environment. You can view and analyze massive amounts of data and gain actionable insight.<br><br>Using New Relic Query Language (NRQL) you can create dashboards and create charts for metric data.</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Summarizing Results</h2>
					<div align ="left">
					<p>Once you’ve gathered metrics you can use them to formulate an overall conclusion about your designs usability. You can show the increase in usability as a results from a redesign.</p>
						</div>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Sharing Results</h2>
					<div align ="left">
					<p>Conveying user research findings can be a challenge – no one wants to read a huge word document or read a long email. Providing enough detail without boring your audience is a difficult balance.</p>
						</div>
				</section>
