					<h2>Introduction to UX</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>The Basics</h3>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>What is User Experience?</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							User experience (UX) focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and their limitations. It also takes into account the business goals and objectives of the group managing the project.<br><br>UX best practices promote improving the quality of the user’s interaction with and perceptions of your product and any related services.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

					<h2>Factors that influence UX</h2>
					<img src="https://eu.landisgyr.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Finland_blog/Better_Tech_Blog/figure1.png?t=1521191709612&width=311&name=figure1.png"/>
						<p>
							At the core UX ensures that users find value in what you are providing them. Peter Morville represents this through his User Experience Honeycomb.
						</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
						<p>	
							Morville notes that in order for there to be a meaningful and valuable user experience, information must be:
							<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Useful:</b> Your content should be original and fulfill a need</li>
								<li><b>Usable:</b> Site must be easy to use</li>
								<li><b>Desirable:</b> Image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation</li>
								<li><b>Findable:</b> Content needs to be navigable and locatable onsite and offsite</li>
								<li><b>Accessible:</b> Content needs to be accessible to people with disabilities</li>
								<li><b>Credible:</b> Users must trust and believe what you tell them</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Usability and UX are not the same thing</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							The usability of a website is a crucial part that shapes its UX – so it falls under the umbrella of UX. Some may think that the usability is solely about the “ease of use” of a site, but it involves much more than that.<br><br>
<b>“The extent to which a product can be used by specific users to achieve specified goals, with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.”</b><br><br>-ISO 9421 Ergonomics of Human System Interaction
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
						<p>
							Usability is more than just about if users can perform tasks easily (ease-of-use). It also deals with the user’s satisfaction – for a website to be useable, it must be engaging and aesthetically pleasing, too. 
						</p>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>Why does Usability matter?</h2>
						<p>
							If users cannot achieve their goals efficiently and effectively, they are likely to seek an alternative solution to reach their goals.<br><br>
						<p>	
							<b>If your product is not usable, its UX will be bad, and users will leave your site for a competitor – plain and simple.</b>
						</p>

	<!-- UX Design Process - The in's and out's-->
				<section>
					<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1408/1*9bpUtbOZiLd-8_NVUAmkHw.png"/>
					<h2>UX Design Process</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>The in's and out's</h3>
						<p>
					
						</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>What does a UX process look like?</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>A UX design process is something that everyone does differently because the process depends heavily on the project.<br><br>Different projects require different approaches: the approach to a corporate website differs from the way you might design a social media app. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/78/fb/44/78fb444ea2f36972782e927e4cfb94af.png"/>
					<p>
						At its core, every UX process should consist of the following 5 phases<br>(not always in this order)
					</p>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>Strategy</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							One of the most important phases in UX design happens before the process even starts. Before you can build an amazing user-friendly website, you need to understand its context for existence.<br><br>
This phase defines the product and sets the stage for the success of a product. UX Designers brainstorm the product with stakeholders. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<p>
						This phase includes:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Stakeholder Discussions:</b> Interviewing key stakeholders for a project allows you to gather insights about their goals and values. </li>
							<li><b>Project Vision/Goals:</b> Map out the key aspects of the product – what is it, who it’s for and when/where it will be used.</li>
							<li><b>Brand Strategy:</b> Creating an early mockup/idea of what is going to be built. </li>
							<li><b>Project Kick-off Meeting:</b> Sets the proper expectations for both the team and stakeholders – outlines the products purpose, includes who is involved in the project, sets expectations for measuring product success (such as KPI’s) and the overall project priority. </li>
						</ul> 
					<p>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h2>Discovery</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							Once the product idea is defined, product research will provide the other half of the foundation for a great design. Conducting research early and often in the design process will save you a lot of resources (time and money) in the long run as adjustments might be made.<br><br>
This phase varies based on the complexity of the product, timing, available resources and other factors. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<p>
						This phase includes:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Competitive Research:</b> Research and analysis of competitor products helps the UX designer understand industry standards and identifies opportunity to improve the product.</li>
							<li><b>Surveys/Interviews:</b> Having a good understanding of your users is essential – who are they, what do they need, what motivates them?</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
		
				<section>
					<h2>Analysis</h2>
					<div align ="left">
						<p>
							Capturing, organizing and making inferences from what users want/think/need can help UX designers understand why they want/think/need in the product. Designers confirm that their assumptions of the users are valid. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<p>
						This phase includes:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Personas:</b> Fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might use your product. The purpose of personas is to create reliable and realistic representations of the audience for reference. </li>
							<li><b>Experience Maps:</b> Design tool used to understand the product interactions from the user’s point of view. It’s a visual representation that illustrates the users experience within a product.</li>
							<li><b>Storyboarding:</b> An effective and inexpensive way to capture, relate, and explore experiences in the design process. It’s a visual representation of stories to communicate user issues to stakeholders.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>	
	
				<section>
					<h2>Design</h2>
					<div align ="left">
						<p>
							When it’s clear what the user’s goals are and how they might operate with the product, UX designers move to the design phase. This phase should require input from all members involved in the project and validates ideas and assumptions. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
	
				<section>
					<p>
						This phase includes:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Site Mapping:</b> Site maps give you a visual representation of the sites organization and how different sections are linked together.</li>
							<li><b>Sketching:</b> Drawing by hand is the fastest way to visualize a concept and allows the designer to explore options.</li>
							<li><b>Wireframes:</b> A visual guide that represents page structure (hierarchy and key elements) – think of this as the skeleton of the sites design.</li>
							<li><b>Prototypes:</b> Builds off the wireframe and incorporates the look and feel. A prototype is a simulation of the product, commonly using clickable functionality.</li>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
	
				<section>
					<h2>Production</h2>
					<div align ="left">
						<p>
							A product is validated with stakeholders and end-users through a series of user testing sessions and design iterations. Once you have validation that your product is usable you can move forward with the development and launch the final product.  
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>This phase includes:
						<ul>
							<li><b>User Testing:</b> User testing sessions serve as validation of design, based on tests with real users. These sessions differ in form, such as usability testing, focus groups, beta testing, A/B testing, and surveys. </li>
							<li><b>Record Findings:</b> Gather quantitative data from testing feedback and research being conducted to improve or iterate the design. </li>

							<li><b>Metrics Analysis:</b> Use an analytics tool to gather qualitative data about how users interact with your product: clicks, navigation time, search queries etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

					<p>
						It’s important to understand that UX design isn’t a linear process – it’s an iterative process. These phases often overlap and go back-and-forth.

	<!-- Research and Understanding - Who, what, where? -->
				<section>
					<img src="https://edsurge.imgix.net/uploads/post/image/9525/shutterstock_287254541-1489449787.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=2000&h=810&fit=crop"/>
					<h2>Research &amp; Understanding</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>Who, What, Where?</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is UX Research?</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							The research part of UX is defined as an action where you investigate something systematically. In UX Research, you apply various techniques to add context and insight into the design process. 
<br><br>
Its needed to reach new conclusions, establish facts, and find problems. In addition, UX research will help you understand the users and their needs, and identify the requirements of the product.
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section>			

				<section>
					<h2>UX Research Techniques</h2> 
						<p>
							UX research methods are great at producing data and insights. User research can be done at any point in the design process. UX methods can keep product-development efforts on track while aligning with the user’s needs. 
						</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Competitive Research</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							Conducting a competitive assessment needs to be part of the ongoing research process to deepen your understandings of the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. You will be able to track trends and scenarios then organize it in a way that can be utilized.  
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>Interviews</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							A common user research technique used typically to get qualitative information from either existing or potential users. Typically performed by two user experience professionals (one to interview and one to take notes) and can cover any range of topics (persons background, occupation, use of technology, their goals, motivations, and pain points).
<br><br>
This will add vital information to any personas you design and help you understand your users.
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>Personas</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							Creating personas can provide a shared understanding of users in terms of goals and capabilities. They can drive design decisions by discussing the users’ needs during the planning process. In most cases, personas are created from data collected from interviews. 
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<p> Persona Example

				<section>
					<h2>Card Sorting</h2>
					<img src="https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/ux-daily/5661bbe0d95b1.jpg"/>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							A method used to help design and evaluate the information architecture of a website. Subject experts or users will organize topics into categories that make sense to create a category tree. This is useful to map workflows, menu structure, or web site navigation paths. 
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>Experience Maps</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							A visual representation that illustrates the users flow (within a product or service), their needs, wants, expectations and overall experience for a goal.<br><br>A simple experience map only reflects one possible path during one scenario, while a complex map could encompass cross platform experiences or experiences occurring at different time sessions/scenarios.  
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
					<img src="http://www.mediabarnresearch.com/storage/slide1.jpg">
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							During a usability test, you evaluate a product or service by testing it with real users. Participants will complete tasks while you observe their actions and takes notes. This type of testing allows you to identify problems before production, determine how satisfied participants are with your product and analyze performance.
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>Why is UX research important?</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p>
							UX research removes assumptions from the design process and you will have real data to back up your design decisions. If research is done correctly it will save your organization valuable time and money. 
<br><br>
With research you’re discovering the right requirements for the right demographic at the right time. 
						</p>	
					</div>
				</section> 


	<!-- Visual Design - prototypes and wire frames -->
				<section>
					<img src="https://dynomapper.com/images/how_to_wireframe_2.jpg"/>
					<h2>Visual Design</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>Prototypes, Mockups and Wireframes</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is a Wireframe?</h2>
					<img src="https://assets.justinmind.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wireframe-mobile-app-examples-ecommerce.png"/>
						<p>
							A low-fidelity, simplified outline of your website or app. It gives you an idea of where everything will eventually go. This bareboned approach makes wireframes a great tool during the initial stages of the visual design process. 
						</p>	
					
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>What is a Mockup?</h2>
					<img src="https://cdn.idevie.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/407cd_design_04-food-blog-website-mockup.jpg"/>
						<p>
							A mid to high fidelity visual outline of your website or app. They reflect the design choices for the overall vision of the product. 
						</p>	
					
				</section> 

				<section>
					<h2>Things to consider:</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Content layout/size</li>
							<li>Contrast</li>
							<li>Color scheme</li>
							<li>Typography</li>
							<li>Spacing</li>
							<li>Navigation</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits of Mockups</h2> 
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Intuitive to stakeholders</b> – they can more easily see the final product.</li>
							<li><b>Realistic perspective</b> – they can reveal problems that aren’t so apparent on paper (color clashes, issues with typography, distribution of content, etc.) </li>
							<li><b>Early revisions</b> – easier to make revisions at this stage than in the later coding (prototype) stage.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is a Prototype?</h2>
						<p>
							A simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch. The goal is to test the prototype in front of real users before sending it off to development. It is essential for resolving usability issues and reveals what may need improvement. 
						</p>	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits of Prototypes:</h2> 
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Representation</b> – type of prototype (paper, mobile, html, desktop)</li>
							<li><b>Precision</b> – level of detail and realism </li>
							<li><b>Interactivity</b> – functionality to the user (fully, partly or view-only)</li>
							<li><b>Evolution</b> – lifecycle of the prototype. (built and improved upon, ultimately evolving into the final product)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Prototyping Methodologies</h2>
						<img src="https://17404-presscdn-0-71-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/studio/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/image031.jpg"/>
						<p>

				<section>
					<h2>Paper Prototyping</h2>
						<img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53fca7a3e4b01fd3d3def04b/t/59a2b7c649fc2b116e72f602/1503836132457/Proto-.jpeg"/>
						<p>
							Works best in the initial stages of design, mainly for testing product ideas. They are fast, inexpensive and can be a great team-building exercise. They can also be kept as reference for future iterations. 
						</p>	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Digital Prototyping</h2>
						<img src="https://getflywheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/style-tile-example.jpg"/>
						<p>
							Most usual form of prototyping that is realistic enough to accurately test most UI elements and easier to produce than HTML prototypes. Can be built using apps and software made for prototyping. 
						</p>	
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Useful Digital Prototyping tools:</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Balsamiq</li>
							<li>Sketch</li>
							<li>Adobe XD/Illustrator/Photoshop</li>
							<li>Invision App</li>
							<li>Webflow</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

				<section>
					<h2>HTML Prototyping</h2>
						<img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a7802a007863545cb39e31698381511f"/>
						<p>
							Only recommended for designers who can code OR have the available resources to create an HTML prototype. Your HTML prototype is only as good as your ability to code – it may be better to go with the prototyping software depending on your situation.
